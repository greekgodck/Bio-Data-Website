                <p>Hi Guys,I have over two and a half years of work experience in Amazon as a Reviewer, having knowledge of creating
                   websites using HTML,CSS3, BOOTSTRAP etc and a formal back ground in Programming gives me a good
                   understanding of niches between technology and design. This helps me bridge the gap between Creative
                   Thinking and Logical Reasoning and find a perfectly balanced solution for any given problem.
                   I hope to acquire understanding of Strategy and Services Design which would help efficiently solve daily
                   problems introduced due to ever growing Technological and Lifestyle Overload.
